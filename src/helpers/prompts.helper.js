1. "project_description": A clear, concise description of the project based on the idea
2. "requirements": An array of requirement objects, where each object has:
   - "title": A short, descriptive title for the requirement
   - "description": A detailed description of what this requirement entails

Example response format:
\`\`\`json
{
  "project_description": "A comprehensive description of the project based on the idea",
  "requirements": [
    {

      "description": "Implement secure user login and registration system"

  ]

IMPORTANT: 
- Your response MUST be wrapped in \`\`\`json and \`\`\` code blocks
- Include only "project_description" and "requirements" fields
- Each requirement must have "title" and "description" fields
- Do not include any other fields or schema metadata
- The JSON must be valid and properly formatted`;

export const formatInstructionForBlackbox = `IMPORTANT: The ONLY valid response is a single JSON object wrapped in triple backticks and marked as json, like this: [triple backtick]json ... [triple backtick]. Any other format (including plain code blocks, unmarked triple backticks, or raw JSON) is invalid and will be rejected.\n\nYou are an AI agent that can create, edit, delete, or read code/files based on user requirements and project structure. You must respond with a JSON object wrapped in triple backticks and marked as json that contains exactly three fields:\n\n1. "remarks": A detailed explanation of what you're creating/editing/deleting/reading and why\n2. "success": A boolean. Set to true if you believe all tasks are complete, false otherwise.\n3. "code": An array of code objects, where each object has:\n   - "tool": Must be one of "create", "edit", "delete", or "read" based on the user's request\n   - "path": The file path to create, edit, delete, or read (optional for some tools)\n   - "code": The actual code content (for create/edit), empty string for delete/read, or omitted if not needed\n   - "start": Line number where edit/delete/read starts (use 0 if not applicable)\n   - "end": Line number where edit/delete/read ends (use 0 if not applicable)\n\nIMPORTANT GUIDELINES:\n- Your response MUST be a single JSON object wrapped in triple backticks and marked as json (for example: [triple backtick]json ... [triple backtick]), and must NOT include any other code blocks (such as [triple backtick]tsx, [triple backtick]js, [triple backtick]css, etc.) or raw code. Only the JSON object is allowed.\n- If the user's request does not specify the file or line numbers to edit, respond with a "read" tool request for the relevant file(s) or ask the user for clarification, instead of returning an "edit" tool response.\n- Only use the "edit" tool when you are certain about the file path and the lines to change.\n- If you need more information, you may ask the user a clarifying question in the remarks field and use the "read" tool to request the file content.\n- When you believe all tasks are complete, respond with success: true and an empty code array: "code": []\n- If you cannot proceed and need more information, respond with success: false and an empty code array. The backend will try again and prompt you for clarification.\n\nExample: User says "Change the homepage text to 'Hello World'"\n`;
